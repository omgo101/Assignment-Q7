## Descriptive Statistics and Probability
 q1) Look at the data given below. Plot the data, find the outliers and find out  μ,σ,σ^2 Name of company Measure X Allied Signal 24.23% Bankers Trust 25.53% General Mills 25.41% ITT Industries 24.14% J.P.Morgan & Co. 29.62% Lehman Brothers 28.25% Marriott 25.81% MCI 24.39% Merrill Lynch 40.26% Microsoft 32.95% Morgan Stanley 91.36% Sun Microsystems 25.99% Travelers 39.42% US Airways 26.71% Warner-Lambert 35.00%(answer in Descriptive Statistics Probability q1.ipynb) <br />

Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above. <br />
q2)(i)	What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies. <br /> <br />
      Ans iqr is approx. is 12-5=7 and iqr is range between (5)q1+(6)q2+(12)q3=iqr (pink box) <br />
(ii)	What can we say about the skewness of this dataset? <br /> <br />
Ans  this its not normal distribution and it is Right-Skewed <br /> <br />
(iii)	If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected? <br /> <br />
Ans no Outliers because of the outlier the data will have  positive skewness it  will normal distributed
